    /// The problem this solves: a node's software catalogue starts empty and only fills when an
    /// operator uploads a package by hand or runs a feed sync. Nothing forces a stranger running
    /// their own node to do either, so the Software Repository pages were a dead end on every
    /// fresh deployment. Rather than requiring every operator to mirror the binaries, the portal
    /// links out to the project's own download page for anything it does not hold locally.
    ///
    /// This never overrides a local package. Resolution order is always local first, link second,
    /// so an operator who uploads their own build keeps serving it, and an air-gapped site that
    /// blanks <see cref="BaseUrl"/> behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
    ///
    /// IMPORTANT: rendering a link is NOT a network call. The node makes no outbound request to
    /// resolve or verify these URLs, and nothing is sent anywhere. Only the operator's browser
    /// travels, and only if they click. The node's offline-first posture is unchanged.
    /// </summary>

    /// Lives in the Portal rather than the shared triad on purpose. The published node
    /// export consumes Febris.SharedServices as a NuGet package and ships no shared/ source,

    /// version. Nothing outside the Portal reads this anyway.
