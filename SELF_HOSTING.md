# Self-hosting a Febris node

This is the whole operator story: what you need, how to bring a node up, what it talks to
(nothing external, by design), and how to deploy the client suite through it.

If you only want it running, read [Quickstart](#quickstart). Everything after that is
operational detail.

---

## Prerequisites

| You need | Why | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker + Compose v2** | the node ships as five containers | `docker --version` and `docker compose version` |
| **openssl** | `selfhost/generate-env.sh` generates your secrets with it and exits if it is missing | `command -v openssl` |
| **POSIX shell (bash)** | `generate-env.sh` is a bash script | `bash --version` |
| **.NET 8 SDK** | only if you want to build or test outside Docker. The compose path does not need it | `dotnet --version` |

You do **not** need a Febris account, licence key, or any network service we run. A node is
standalone. That is the point of the project, not a configuration option.

---

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone <this-repo> febris-node && cd febris-node
./selfhost/generate-env.sh          # writes .env with fresh secrets, chmod 600
docker compose up -d --build        # first build takes a few minutes
```

Then open **https://febris.localhost:8443**.

`generate-env.sh` prints your first-login credentials and stores them in `.env`. Log in with
`NODE_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `NODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and **change the password immediately** -- it was
generated on your machine, but it is sitting in a file.

It refuses to run twice: if `.env` already exists it exits non-zero unless you pass `--force`,
which rewrites the file and so rotates `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `NODE_JWT_SECRET` -- the ones an
already-provisioned `pgdata` volume and every issued device token still depend on.

### Verifying it came up

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/health/ready                 # {"status":"Healthy","totalDurationMs":7}
docker compose ps                                       # five: postgres, valkey, node-api, node-portal healthy; proxy up
```

`/health/ready` answers `Healthy` only when every dependency it checks is healthy, so that one
field is a complete readiness answer.

**It does not tell you WHICH dependency failed, by default.** The per-check breakdown names every
registered check, which tells an unauthenticated caller which databases this node owns and whether
Redis and hub federation are configured -- an inventory of your deployment, on an endpoint that has
to stay anonymous. Set `HealthChecks__DetailedResponse=true` in your `.env` when you need the
breakdown to diagnose a partial failure, and prefer turning it off again afterwards.

**The probes are host-local, not public.** This used to say
`curl -k https://febris.localhost:8443/health/ready`, through the bundled proxy. The proxy now
returns 404 for `/health/*` on both vhosts, because the readiness body names every registered check
and would let an unauthenticated caller enumerate which databases the node owns, whether Redis is
configured and whether hub federation is on. That costs nothing operationally: the container
healthchecks run inside the containers and the API publishes `127.0.0.1:8081` for exactly this. If
you need the probes from elsewhere, put them behind your own authentication rather than reopening
the path.

The TLS certificate is self-signed by the bundled Caddy proxy, which is why `curl` needs `-k`
and your browser will warn once. For a real deployment see [TLS](#tls-and-reverse-proxying).

---

## What is actually running

| Service | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | four databases: user, data, xapi, analytics |
| `valkey` | `valkey/valkey:8-alpine` | session and token state (Redis-protocol drop-in) |
| `node-api` | built here | the API: xAPI ingest, artifact store, identity |
| `node-portal` | built here | the web UI |
| `proxy` | `caddy:2-alpine` | TLS termination and routing |

State lives in named volumes: `pgdata`, `valkeydata`, `storage` (uploaded artifacts), `keys`
(the DataProtection key ring), `caddydata`, `caddyconfig`. **Back those up.** `docker compose
down` keeps them; `docker compose down -v` destroys them, including every uploaded package.

### Configuration

Everything is environment variables, read from `.env`. The ones you are likely to touch:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_HTTPS_PORT` | `8443` | the port the portal is served on |
| `NODE_API_HTTP_PORT` | `8081` | plain-HTTP API port, for host-local health probes. The portal is deliberately **not** served over it -- its auth cookie is HTTPS-only |
| `NODE_API_HTTP_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | which interface that port binds to. **Loopback by default**: the API carries device tokens, the hardware credential and learner records, so publishing it to the LAN sends all of it in cleartext. Point devices at the HTTPS API host instead. `0.0.0.0` opts back in, for a device that genuinely cannot trust the local CA, on a network you control |
| `NODE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | generated | the bootstrap administrator |
| `NODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | generated | blank is valid -- see below |
| `NODE_AUTO_PROVISION_JIT` | `false` | forwarded to the portal as `Identity__Registration__AutoProvisionJit`. `true` lets an unknown external-IdP user be provisioned an account on first login. Closed by default, and inert until you actually register an SSO provider |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_SENDER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | placeholder | outbound mail. Nothing is sent until you set these |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `NODE_JWT_SECRET` | generated | rotate by editing `.env` and recreating the containers |

**On the bootstrap admin.** If `NODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is blank the account is created without a
password and you set one through the forgot-password email flow -- which needs SMTP configured.
That is deliberate: the project never stores a password you did not choose. If
`NODE_ADMIN_EMAIL` is also blank, the node seeds a placeholder `admin@example.com` account with
no password, which is inert until you configure one.

### Adding users

Self-registration ships closed -- `Identity.Registration.Mode` is `AdminOnly` and
`AutoProvisionJit` is `false` -- so nobody signs themselves up. You add your team from the
portal, signed in as an admin:

| Page | For |
|---|---|
| `/User/Create` | one account at a time |
| `/User/BulkCreate` | paste a spreadsheet, or upload a CSV |

Both are gated on the admin/educator roles rather than on the registration policy, so closing
self-registration does not close them.

**These need SMTP.** An admin-created account is given a randomly generated password that is
never shown to you and never sent to the user: the only way in is a link by email -- the
confirmation mail on single create, the forgot-password flow otherwise. Bulk create sends no
mail at all, so those accounts are reachable only through forgot-password. With `SMTP_HOST`
blank nothing is delivered, and you have made accounts nobody can ever log into. Configure SMTP
*before* you provision users.

## Deploy the client suite through your node

A node is not only an LMS -- it is the distribution point for the Febris client software. This
is the supported path for getting the mobile suite onto devices, and for a single-headset owner
it is the **only** path: the Companion app is served by a node, so an individual owner runs
their own node exactly as an organisation does.

The whole operator side lives on the **portal**, behind the same signed-in cookie identity and
role gates as every other admin action. There is no API credential to mint and no curl sequence:
the NodeAdmin bearer token that earlier revisions of this page documented (one hour, no refresh,
no revocation) was deleted when the writes moved into the portal, because it existed solely to
let a human reach API-side write routes that no longer exist.

Who talks to what:

| Surface | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Portal -> Software Repository pages | signed-in cookie, educator or admin | download, documentation, archive per platform |
| Portal -> **Upload a package** (on each Archive page) | signed-in cookie, **admin only** | ingest a package you hold |
| Portal -> **System -> Node -> Package Feed** | signed-in cookie, **admin only** | pull packages from a release feed |
| `api/CompanionApp/GetLatestVersion` + `Download` | device token | the mobile Server fetches the Companion APK |
| `api/Module/*` | device token | module catalogue + entitlement-gated module delivery |

A device identity cannot put anything into the catalogue, since the writes are portal-only. An
operator does not need a device identity to read it, because the portal serves the same store.

### (a) Upload a package by hand

Software Repository -> your platform -> **Archive** -> **Upload a package**. The form carries the
`.zip` plus the catalogue metadata (name, version, kind, language), and an optional **UUID**
field: supply an existing package's UUID (shown in the Archive table) to update that row and
replace its stored bytes in place. Leave it empty to add a new version row. It lands through
`IPackageIngestLogic`, the same ingest the feed sync uses. This is a first-class supported
path, not a fallback. Use it for air-gapped installs, or when you build the clients yourself.

What you upload is a plain `.zip`. There is no signature envelope and the node verifies no
signature. Ingest re-reads the stored bytes and **records** their `sha256` so the catalogue can
prove afterwards what it is serving -- but on this path there is nothing to compare it against,
because no manifest declared an expected value. Checksum *refusal* is real, and it happens on
the feed-sync path in (b).

### (b) Pull from a release feed

**System -> Node -> Package Feed** on the portal. Point it at the manifest URL of whichever feed
you trust (HTTPS only, and an air-gapped node can point at a manifest served on its own network),
pick a channel, and run it. The form defaults to **dry run**, which is the recommended first
pass: it produces the same per-package report and changes nothing. Untick it for the real
thing. The report renders inline: ingested, already current, filtered, refused and failed, one
row per package with its reason.

The sync is deliberately conservative:

- **checksum-refusal** -- a package failing `sha256` is rejected, not stored
- **oldest-first** -- versions are applied in order, so a catalogue cannot skip a release
- **never-overwrite** -- an existing version is never silently replaced

One honest limit: the feed format carries a `signerSha256` per payload -- the digest of the APK
signing certificate, the only field that speaks to *origin* rather than integrity -- but the node
does not pin or enforce it. Only the artifact checksum is verified.

The manifest is a static JSON document you host yourself. There is no distribution service to
operate. `schemaVersion` must be `1`, and an entry is skipped if its `channel` is not the one
you asked for, if it is `obsolete`, or if it lists `consumers` that exclude `node`:

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generated": "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "packages": [
    {
      "uuid": "...stable release identity, never reused...",
      "kind": "AndroidMobileServer",
      "kindId": 200,
      "name": "Febris Mobile Server",
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "versionCode": 10200,
      "channel": "stable",
      "consumers": ["human", "node"],
      "description": "...",
      "packageName": "com.example.febris.server",
      "minSdk": 26,
      "targetSdk": 34,
      "obsolete": false,
      "artifact": {
        "fileName": "febris-server-1.2.0.zip",
        "url": "https://.../febris-server-1.2.0.zip",
        "sizeBytes": 41234567,
        "sha256": "...lowercase hex sha-256 of the zip as served..."
      },
      "contains": [
        { "fileName": "server.apk", "sha256": "...", "signerSha256": "..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`kind` and `kindId` are redundant on purpose: a disagreement is a fatal error for that entry,
not something the node resolves in favour of one side. `versionCode` is what the sync orders by.

There is currently **no portal button and no scheduler** for this. You invoke it yourself, from
a cron job or by hand. That is a real gap, not a design stance.

### (c) Devices pull from the catalogue

Nothing further to configure. Point the mobile Server at your node's API URL and it reads
`GetLatestVersion` / `Download` on its own schedule. The catalogue is the contract.

### (d) Day-one scope: mobile only

The kinds that work end-to-end today are **`AndroidMobileServer` (200)** and
**`AndroidMobileCompanion` (300)**.

`PC = 100`, `CSharp = 400` and `CPP = 500` are reserved values in the enum and in the manifest
format, but there is no PC-through-node delivery flow -- the PC suite installs from a zip. The
slots exist so the feed format does not need to change when that lands.

---

## TLS and reverse proxying

The bundled Caddy terminates TLS with a self-signed certificate so the quickstart works with no
DNS. For anything real, use your own reverse proxy and terminate there.

### If you already run a reverse proxy

This is the common case, and until 2026-08-25 the recipe did not actually support it: the portal
published no host port at all, so there was nothing for your proxy to point at and the only option
was running the bundled Caddy as a second proxy behind your first one.

Use the overlay:

```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:selfhost/docker-compose.byo-proxy.yml
docker compose up -d
```

That publishes the portal on `127.0.0.1:8082` and switches the bundled Caddy off. The API is
already on `127.0.0.1:8081`. Point your proxy at those two, as two hostnames -- a subpath mount is
not supported, because nothing in the app rewrites generated URLs for a path prefix.

**Set `COMPOSE_FILE` rather than passing `-f`.** The upgrade command below is a bare
`docker compose up -d --build`, which converges to the base file alone: it would restart the
bundled proxy and drop the portal port without saying anything.

The overlay's header is the full contract your proxy has to satisfy. The five that bite hardest:

| Do this | Because |
|---|---|
| Set `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` | The node decides "was this HTTPS" from the header. Without it, HSTS is skipped and the Secure auth cookie is never emitted, so **login cannot work**. |
| Preserve the `Host` header | nginx rewrites it by default. Every password-reset and invitation link is built from `Request.Host`, so mail goes out pointing at your upstream's internal name. |
| Overwrite `X-Real-IP`, do not pass it through | It is written straight into the analytics tables with no trust check. |
| Raise the body limit and read timeouts | Module and package uploads are far larger than a default proxy will pass. nginx caps bodies at `1m`. |
| Add your proxy to `ForwardedHeaders__KnownNetworks__1` | Only the compose subnet is trusted by default, so a proxy on the host or another machine is ignored. Use index `__1` -- `__0` is already taken. |

The app does **not** redirect HTTP to HTTPS by default, because a node behind a TLS-terminating
proxy would loop. Turn it on with `Transport__HttpsRedirection=true` only if the app itself
terminates TLS.

The `Transport` section also controls HSTS, CORS and `X-Frame-Options`:

```jsonc
"Transport": {
  "Hsts": { "Enabled": true, "MaxAgeDays": 365, "IncludeSubdomains": true, "Preload": false },
  "HttpsRedirection": false,
  "Cors": { "AllowedHosts": [ ".example.com" ], "AllowCredentials": true },
  "SecurityHeaders": { "XContentTypeOptions": true, "XXssProtection": true, "XFrameOptions": "SameOrigin" }
}
```

`Cors.AllowedHosts` is empty by default, which means only same-origin and localhost. An entry
with a leading dot (`.example.com`) matches the domain and its subdomains. Without one it is an
exact host match. Set `Preload` only once you have actually submitted to the HSTS preload list --
it is close to irreversible.

---

## Backups

```sh
docker compose exec postgres pg_dumpall -U febris > febris-$(date +%F).sql
docker run --rm -v febris-node_storage:/from -v "$PWD":/to alpine \
  tar czf /to/storage-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /from .
```

Compose prefixes volume names with the project name, which defaults to the directory you cloned
into -- `febris-node_storage` assumes that is `febris-node`. If you cloned elsewhere, or set
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, run `docker volume ls` and use the name you actually have. Otherwise the
archive comes out empty.

Back up the `keys` volume too. The DataProtection key ring encrypts auth cookies and
at-rest settings. Losing it logs everyone out and makes encrypted settings unreadable.

```sh
docker run --rm -v febris-node_keys:/from -v "$PWD":/to alpine \
  tar czf /to/keys-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /from .
```

**Run the dump from inside the container, as above.** `pg_dumpall` refuses to work against a server
newer than itself, and it aborts rather than producing a partial file:

```
pg_dump: error: server version: 18.4; pg_dump version: 12.3
pg_dump: error: aborting because of server version mismatch
```

The container's client tools always match the server it ships with, so `docker compose exec` sidesteps
the whole problem. If you dump from the host instead, your client must be at least the server's major
version.

A backup you have never restored is a hypothesis. Restore into a scratch database at least once
before you need it, using the drill at the end of the next section.

---

## Restoring

**Read this before you need it.** Restoring is not the reverse of `up -d` and there is no undo.

### 1. Stop the applications, leave the database running

```sh
docker compose stop node-api node-portal
```

Both hosts migrate on boot and write continuously. Restoring underneath a running host gives you a
database that disagrees with what the application already has in memory.

### 2. Restore the databases

`pg_dumpall` writes a plain SQL script containing `CREATE DATABASE` and `\connect`, so it is replayed
with `psql`, **not** `pg_restore`. (`pg_restore` is for archives produced by `pg_dump -Fc`. Using the
wrong one is the most common way this goes wrong at three in the morning.)

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U febris -d postgres < febris-2026-08-18.sql
```

The dump recreates each database. If a database of the same name already exists the script errors on
that object and carries on, which leaves a half-old, half-new mixture. To restore onto a system that
already has data, drop the four databases first and mean it:

```sh
docker compose exec postgres psql -U febris -d postgres \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS febris_user' \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS febris_data' \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS febris_xapi' \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS febris_analytics'
```

Those four names are what `docker-compose.yml` configures. A node someone has customised, or a
development checkout, may use different ones -- check the `ConnectionStrings__*` values in your
compose file rather than trusting this list, and `\l` in psql shows what is actually there.

> This destroys current data irreversibly. Take a fresh dump of the CURRENT state first, even if you
> believe it is broken. A dump of a broken system is still evidence, and it is the only way back if
> the backup you are restoring turns out to be worse.

### 3. Restore the volumes

The databases are only part of the node. `storage` holds uploaded video and files, and `keys` holds
the DataProtection key ring.

```sh
docker run --rm -v febris-node_storage:/to -v "$PWD":/from alpine \
  sh -c 'rm -rf /to/* && tar xzf /from/storage-2026-08-18.tar.gz -C /to'
docker run --rm -v febris-node_keys:/to -v "$PWD":/from alpine \
  sh -c 'rm -rf /to/* && tar xzf /from/keys-2026-08-18.tar.gz -C /to'
```

**Restore `keys` from the same moment as the database, or not at all.** The key ring decrypts auth
cookies and at-rest settings. A database from Tuesday with a key ring from Friday leaves settings
that cannot be decrypted, and the symptom is not an obvious error.

### 4. Start, and verify

```sh
docker compose up -d
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/health/ready
```

`/health/ready` proves each database is reachable, and the `schema-user`, `schema-data` and
`schema-xapi` checks additionally prove there are no unapplied migrations, so a restore that produced
a stale schema shows up here rather than as a runtime error later.

Two things it does not tell you. **Analytics has no schema check** -- it is provisioned with
`EnsureCreated` rather than migrations, so nothing verifies its shape. And a green probe says nothing
about the ROWS: it proves the tables exist, not that your data came back. Log in and open one screen
carrying real content before you call the restore done.

### 5. Prove it on a scratch database first

Never rehearse on the live node. This drill touches nothing real:

```sh
docker compose exec postgres psql -U febris -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE restore_drill'
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U febris -d restore_drill < febris-2026-08-18.sql
docker compose exec postgres psql -U febris -d restore_drill -c '\dt'
docker compose exec postgres psql -U febris -d postgres -c 'DROP DATABASE restore_drill'
```

If the dump replays cleanly and the tables are there, the backup is real. If it does not, you have
found that out on a day when it costs nothing.

---

## Upgrading, and getting back

```sh
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Migrations run at startup and are **forward-only**. There are no `Down` paths wired into the
deployment, so a bad release cannot be undone by re-running the tooling.

**Take a dump before every upgrade.** That dump is the rollback, and it is the only one.

### Rolling back a bad release

Rolling back code is easy. Rolling back a release whose migrations already ran is not, because the
old code will not recognise the new schema.

```sh
# 1. Go back to the commit that was running before.
git log --oneline -5
git checkout <previous-commit>

# 2. Rebuild and restart.
docker compose up -d --build
```

If the release you are backing out **did not** add a migration, that is the whole procedure. Confirm
with `git diff <previous-commit>..<bad-commit> -- enduser/FebrisEndUserDAL/Migrations` returning
nothing.

If it **did** add one, the schema is ahead of the code you just deployed and you must also restore
the pre-upgrade database dump using the section above. Do not try to hand-drop the new columns:
`__EFMigrationsHistory` still names the migration, so the node will believe it is applied and will
not recreate it.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Portal returns 502.** The API is still starting, usually applying migrations on first boot.
`docker compose logs -f node-api`.

**`/health/ready` reports a database unhealthy.** Postgres came up after the API. It retries.
If it persists, check `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` matches what the volume was initialised with. A
changed password against an existing `pgdata` volume fails exactly this way.

**Login fails with the generated credentials.** Confirm you are using `NODE_ADMIN_EMAIL` from
`.env` and not an address you assumed. If you set `NODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` by hand and it fails the
password policy (>= 8 characters with an upper, a lower and a digit, a symbol optional), the
seed logs the rejection and creates *no* account -- the node still comes up and still reports
`/health/ready` Healthy, so nothing else looks wrong. Confirm with
`docker compose logs node-portal | grep 'failed creating SuperAdmin'`, which prints Identity's
own reason. Then fix the password in `.env` and `docker compose up -d node-portal` to re-run the
seed. If `NODE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` was blank the account has no password by design -- use the
forgot-password flow, which needs SMTP.

**A user you created cannot log in.** Admin-provisioned accounts get a generated password that
is never shown to anyone, so the account is reachable only through an emailed link. With
`SMTP_HOST` blank nothing was ever sent. Configure SMTP, recreate the containers, then have the
user run forgot-password. See [Adding users](#adding-users).

**Certificate warnings.** Expected, because the bundled cert is self-signed. See
[TLS](#tls-and-reverse-proxying).

**Port already in use.** Change `NODE_HTTPS_PORT` (or `NODE_API_HTTP_PORT`, which publishes the
plain-HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:8081` by default) in `.env` and `docker compose up -d` again.
